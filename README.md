# Minicord - A minimized discord theme for **Desktop Refresh**
A Discord theme intended to **streamline the discord client** by minimizing, shrinking, or otherwise adjusting various elements to **improve the user experience on multiple platforms.**

Compatible clients:
* Discord desktop application (Vencord, BetterDiscord, Equicord, etc.)
* Discord web (Must install extension provided by one of the aforementioned modded clients)
* Vendroid

Compatible with *most* themes (see the list below for specifics):
* Official themes:
  *  Light themes
  *  Dark themes
  *  Nitro themes

* Custom themes:
  * Any theme that does **NOT** alter element margins or spacing for major sections
    * (Major section examples: server members list, server channels list, etc.)
## Recommendations
1. Use "Compact" UI density (as the theme was mostly designed around this setting)
    > **Navigation:** Settings -> Appearance -> UI Density -> "Compact" option

&ensp;&ensp;*You **can** use a different "UI Density" setting, but I did not account for this and thus it may not look pretty*  

3. That's all!
## Installation
Note: It is recommended to use hyperlinks as client mods (Vencord, BetterDiscord, etc.) will automatically fetch the latest version via GitHub Pages.

### Vencord (Recommended method: Hyperlink)
1. **Navigation:** Settings -> Themes -> Online Themes
2. Paste the following link into the textbox: `https://newbranflakes.github.io/minicord/minicord-theme.css`
3. Done!

If you would rather have a local file on your device, then simply save the raw text as a `.css` file type to your themes folder.
> (Vencord has the handy "Open Themes Folder" button to help you navigate to the correct file location)

## Disclaimer
This theme is mainly for my personal use, so expect sporatic and infrequent changes.
